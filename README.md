# About

A command-line program to manage OSINT data and perform searches using several popular tools.

## Features

- Create and manage simple JSON-backed databases of records
- **Holehe email enumeration** fully integrated (requires `holehe` package)
- **HaveIBeenPwned** breach lookup
- **WHOIS** domain lookup
- **DNS lookup** (A, MX, NS records; install `dnspython` for full functionality)
- **IP geolocation** via the free ip-api.com service
- **Social Media Lookback** - Open whopostedwhat.com to search historical social media posts
- **Subdomain Enumeration** - Find hidden subdomains using Certificate Transparency logs and DNS brute force
- **Person Search & OSINT** - Multiple methods to research people:
  - Search by name across social platforms
  - Search by username with automatic profile verification
  - Search by phone number (with links to lookup services)
  - Search by email to find associated social profiles
  - Reverse phone lookup tools
- **Configuration menu** for storing API keys (HIBP, Shodan, etc.)
- Save all scan results into selected databases for future reference

## Installation

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install or update them, simply run the appropriate script for your OS. The install scripts now perform an upgrade of any existing packages and **automatically launch the program** once the dependencies are ready.

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell or CMD)
install.bat

# Unix / macOS
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Running the script will install or upgrade all packages in the requirements file and then start `main.py`. You can re‑run the installer at any time to update to newer dependency versions.

The scripts install packages using `pip --user`. You may need to add the Python `Scripts` folder (Windows) or `~/.local/bin` (Linux/macOS) to your `PATH` so that commands like `holehe` work globally.

Configuration is persisted in `config.json` (created automatically). You can manage API keys through the configuration menu in the application or by editing this file directly.

## Usage

Run the main program using:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Main Menu Options

1. **Database Management** - Create, delete, and manage JSON databases
2. **Email Search (Holehe)** - Search email addresses across 100+ platforms
3. **Email Search (HaveIBeenPwned)** - Check if emails appear in known breaches
4. **Domain Lookup (WHOIS)** - Get WHOIS information for domains
5. **DNS Lookup** - Query A, MX, and NS records
6. **IP Geolocation** - Find the geographic location of IP addresses
7. **Social Media Lookback** - Access whopostedwhat.com for historical social media data
8. **Subdomain Enumeration** - Discover hidden subdomains and enumerate potential attack surfaces
9. **Person Search & OSINT** - Research individuals through multiple methods
10. **Configuration** - Set up API keys for enhanced functionality
11. **Exit** - Close the application

Navigate the menus to manage databases or perform OSINT queries. When performing scans, you can save positive results to a database for later review.

## API Keys and Configuration

For Have I Been Pwned lookups you can set the `HIBP_API_KEY` environment variable to avoid rate limits. You can also manage API keys through the Configuration menu within the application for Shodan and other services.

## Extending the Tool

Additional OSINT integrations can be added by implementing new methods in `OSINTManager` and updating the menu structure. The modular design makes it easy to plug in new lookup functions.
